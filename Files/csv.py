What is a CSV file?
A CSV file is a type of plain text file that uses specific structuring to arrange tabular data.
CSV is a common format for data interchange as it's compact, simple and general.
Many online services allow its users to export tabular data from the website into a CSV file.
Files of CSV will open into Excel, and nearly all databases have a tool to allow import from CSV file.
The standard format is defined by rows and columns data.
Moreover, each row is terminated by a newline to begin the next row.
Also within the row, each column is separated by a comma.
"""

"""
CSV Sample File.
Data in the form of tables is also called CSV (comma separated values)
- literally "comma-separated values."
This is a text format intended for the presentation of tabular data.
Each line of the file is one line of the table.
The values of individual columns are separated by a separator symbol - a comma (,), a semicolon (;) or
another symbol. CSV can be easily read and processed by Python.
